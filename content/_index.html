                Our business model is simple: We want to sell effective
                software solutions without gathering privacy invading information.

                <p>
                    Here's a few of the principles we are committed to upholding 
                    as we develop our business.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    <span class="label">Nickname & Password</span> 
                    This is the <strong>minimum</strong> info needed in order to 
                    provide secure online software solutions. We are aiming to also make it
                    the <strong>maximum</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We don't want to know who you are, what your mothers maiden name
                    is or what you had for breakfast last week. In all honesty, 
                    <strong>we just want your money!</strong>
                </p>

                    <span class="label">Challenge Authority</span> 
                    If someone, some organisation or even some governing body tells 
                    us we must gather a certain piece of information and we don't 
                    need it to operate our software, <strong>we are going to challenge 
                        that requirement</strong>.

                    <span class="label">Honesty and Transparency</span> 
                    We aim to be open about as much of the business, our goals and our
                    processes as we can. We
                    are working on making our roadmap public and even plan to open
                    up some of our financial information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We have already made our <a href="https://plausible.io/flxs.co.uk">

                    <span class="label">Make privacy the new norm</span> 
                    We're digging through the internet to find suppliers and
                    partners that share our vision and ethos, and choosing them 
                    over less privacy respecting competitors.

                <p>
                    We've chosen <a href="http://plausible.io">plausible.io</a> over
                    Google Analytics for this very reason.
